          <b>Vitruvian Man</b>, a drawing made in about 1490. It was made
          accompanied by the notes of Roman Architect
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitruvius">Vitruvius</a>. The
          art was drawn on paper using ink. It is kept in the Gabinetto dei
          disegni e delle stampe of the Gallerie dell'Accademia, in Venice,
          Italy, under reference 228. It is displayed to the public only
          occasionally, so it is not part of the normal exhibition of the

          <b>The Last Supper</b>, was worked on by Leonardo from about 1495 to
          1498 but was not continuously worked on. It was commissioned as part
          of a renovation plan to the Convent of Santa Maria delle Grazie in
          Milan, Italy by Leonardo's patron
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludovico_Sforza"
            >Ludovico Sforza</a
          >, Duke of Milan. The painting shows the scene of the Last Supper of
          Jesus with his apostles. Little of the original painting remains today
          due to a variety of environmental factors, intentional damage and the
          methods used to restore it. The last restoration attempt was in 1999.

          > and his pupil Leonardo Da Vinci. John the Baptist is clothed in robes
          with a halo above his head while barefoot in the river. There are two
          angels kneeling and holding Jesus's garment, and the other with its
          hands folded, both in front of the symbolisation of salvation and
          life, the palm tree. Jesus has a halo over his head as he is depicted
          praying barefoot in the river.
